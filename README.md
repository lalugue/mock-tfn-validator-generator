# Mock TFN Generator and Validator

A web-based development/testing tool for generating and validating mock Australian Tax File Numbers (TFN). Adapted from and inspired by Steve Swinsburg's [TFN Validator](https://github.com/steveswinsburg/tfn-validator), the `Mock TFN Generator and Validator` extends the project with several features such as a mock TFN generator, an implementation in a modern framework (React/Next.js), unit tests, types (TypeScript), and more.

# Developer/Template guide

(Note: The section below is also the one shipped with the Next.js default template)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
